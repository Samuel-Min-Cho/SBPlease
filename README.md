Split Bill Please

I was broke. Well I'm still broke. 
Graduated undergrad this summer and still couldn't find a job. 
All that being said, I was and stil am a broke / jobless / food disposer (just for now).

Despite my budget, I like hanging out with my friends. Even though I don't have many, every Sunday after church I would like to touch some grass with them.
Thanks to all of them who spend their time with me, but I can afford what I eat ONLY.
When we have more than 5 people it is quite hard to ask server to split our bill.
Some restaurants even have their own policy of 'NO Split Bill' during the rush hours. 
Solution was not that simple: 
  1) Me paying for the whole table
  2) Open up the Microsoft Excel on my labptop
  3) Punch in all the items + price
  4) Set up the formula to calculate tax + tip for each item
Well they are simple tasks, but WAY TO TIDIOUS.
